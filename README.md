# StrainFusionNet: Multi-Sensor Image Fusion and Deep Learning for Stress-Strain Prediction

## Overview
**StrainFusionNet** is an advanced framework integrating **multi-sensor imaging** and **deep learning** for predicting stress and strain distributions in structural mechanics. This project bridges the gap between traditional finite element methods (FEM) and emerging data-driven techniques, ensuring precise and efficient analysis of material behavior under complex conditions.

## Background  
Traditional stress-strain prediction models, such as **finite element methods (FEM)** and **classical constitutive models**, often struggle to account for:
- **Heterogeneous materials** with complex microstructures.
- **Nonlinear stress-strain relationships** beyond classical approximations.
- **Computational efficiency** limitations in large-scale simulations.

To address these challenges, **StrainFusionNet** introduces the **Stress-Strain Adaptive Predictive Model (SSAPM)**, which synergizes **mechanistic modeling** with **deep learning-based corrections**, leveraging **multi-sensor image fusion** and **adaptive optimization strategies**.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Sensor Image Fusion**: Combines thermal, infrared, optical, and X-ray images to enhance stress-strain predictions.
- **Physics-Informed Deep Learning**: Embeds physical constraints to improve model generalization.
- **Hybrid Modeling Approach**: Integrates mechanistic FEM with data-driven corrections.
- **Adaptive Optimization & Modular Design**: Improves computational efficiency and scalability.
- **Experimental Validation**: Demonstrates superior accuracy over conventional models.

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition & Multi-Sensor Fusion**  
   - Collect stress-strain images from thermal, infrared, and X-ray sensors.
   - Perform image registration and feature fusion.
   
2. **Feature Extraction & Representation Learning**  
   - Extract stress-strain features using deep convolutional networks.
   - Generate hybrid representations combining physics-based and data-driven features.

3. **SSAPM Architecture**  
   - Develop an adaptive neural network incorporating mechanistic constraints.
   - Utilize reduced-order modeling to enhance computational scalability.

4. **Prediction & Validation**  
   - Train the model on experimental and simulated datasets.
   - Evaluate performance against FEM and classical constitutive models.
